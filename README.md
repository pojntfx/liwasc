## Overview

liwasc is a high-performance network and port scanner. It can quickly give you a overview of the nodes in your network, the services that run on them and manage their power status.

It can ...

- **Scan a network**: Using an ARP scan and the [mac2vendor](https://mac2vendor.com/) database, liwasc can list the nodes in a network, their power status, manufacturer information, IP & MAC addresses and more metadata
- **Scan a node**: Using a high-performance custom TCP and UDP port scanner, liwasc can list the ports and services of a node and provide metadata (service names, registration dates etc.) using the [Service Name and Transport Protocol Port Number Registry](https://www.iana.org/assignments/service-names-port-numbers/service-names-port-numbers.xhtml)
- **Power on a node**: By sending [Wake-on-LAN packets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wake-on-LAN), liwasc can turn on nodes in a network
- **Periodically scan a network**: Using the integrated periodic scans feature, liwasc can periodically (based on a CRON syntax) scan a network and persist the results in a database
- **Give remote insight into a network**: Because liwasc is based on open web technologies, has a gRPC API and supports OpenID Connect authentication, liwasc can be securely exposed to the public internet and serve as a remote controller for a network
