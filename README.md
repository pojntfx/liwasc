## Overview

liwasc is a high-performance network and port scanner. It can quickly give you a overview of the nodes in your network, the services that run on them and manage their power status.

It can ...

- **Scan a network**: Using an ARP scan and the [mac2vendor](https://mac2vendor.com/) database, liwasc can list the nodes in a network, their power status, manufacturer information, IP & MAC addresses and more metadata
- **Scan a node**: Using a high-performance custom TCP and UDP port scanner, liwasc can list the ports and services of a node and provide metadata (service names, registration dates etc.) using the [Service Name and Transport Protocol Port Number Registry](https://www.iana.org/assignments/service-names-port-numbers/service-names-port-numbers.xhtml)
- **Power on a node**: By sending [Wake-on-LAN packets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wake-on-LAN), liwasc can turn on nodes in a network
- **Periodically scan a network**: Using the integrated periodic scans feature, liwasc can periodically (based on a CRON syntax) scan a network and persist the results in a database
- **Give remote insight into a network**: Because liwasc is based on open web technologies, has a gRPC API and supports OpenID Connect authentication, liwasc can be securely exposed to the public internet and serve as a remote controller for a network

## Installation

### Containerized

You can get the Docker container like so:

```shell
$ docker pull pojntfx/liwasc-backend
```

### Natively

If you prefer a native installation, static binaries are also available on [GitHub releases](https://github.com/pojntfx/liwasc/releases).

You can install them like so:

```shell
$ curl -L -o /tmp/liwasc-backend https://github.com/pojntfx/liwasc/releases/download/latest/liwasc-backend.linux-$(uname -m)
$ sudo install /tmp/liwasc-backend /usr/local/bin
$ sudo setcap cap_net_raw+ep /usr/local/bin/liwasc-backend # This allows rootless execution
```

### About the Frontend

The frontend is also available on [GitHub releases](https://github.com/pojntfx/liwasc/releases) in the form of a static `.tar.gz` archive; to deploy it, simply upload it to a CDN or copy it to a web server. For most users, this shouldn't be necessary though; thanks to [@maxence-charriere](https://github.com/maxence-charriere)'s [go-app package](https://go-app.dev/), liwasc is a progressive web app. By simply visiting the [public deployment](https://pojntfx.github.io/liwasc/) once, it will be available for offline use whenever you need it.

## Usage

### Setting up Authentication

liwasc uses [OpenID Connect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenID_Connect) for authentication, which means you can use almost any authentication provider, both self-hosted and as a service, that you want to. We've created a short tutorial video which shows how to set up [Auth0](https://auth0.com/) for this purpose, but feel free to use something like [Ory](https://github.com/ory/hydra) if you prefer a self-hosted solution:

### Starting the Backend (Containerized)

Using Docker (or an alternative like Podman), you can easily start & configure the backend; see the [Reference](#reference) for more configuration parameters:

```shell
$ docker run \
    --name liwasc-backend \
    -d \
    --restart always \
    --net host \
    --cap-add NET_RAW \
    --ulimit nofile=16384:16384 \
    -v ${HOME}/.local/share/liwasc:/root/.local/share/liwasc:z \
    -e LIWASC_BACKEND_OIDCISSUER=https://pojntfx.eu.auth0.com/ \
    -e LIWASC_BACKEND_OIDCCLIENTID=myoidcclientid \
    -e LIWASC_BACKEND_DEVICENAME=eth0 \
    pojntfx/liwasc-backend
```

You can get the logs like so:

```shell
$ docker logs liwasc-backend
```

### Starting the Backend (Natively)

If you prefer a native setup, you can also do a more traditional setup.

First, set up a config file at `~/.local/share/liwasc/etc/liwasc/liwasc-backend-config.yaml`; see the [Reference](#reference) for more configuration parameters:

```shell
$ mkdir -p ~/.local/share/liwasc/etc/liwasc/
$ cat <<EOT >~/.local/share/liwasc/etc/liwasc/liwasc-backend-config.yaml
oidcIssuer: https://pojntfx.eu.auth0.com/
oidcClientID: myoidcclientid
deviceName: eth0
EOT
```

Now, create a systemd service for it:

```shell
$ mkdir -p ~/.config/systemd/user/
$ cat <<EOT >~/.config/systemd/user/liwasc-backend.service
[Unit]
Description=liwasc

[Service]
ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/liwasc-backend -c \${HOME}/.local/share/liwasc/etc/liwasc/liwasc-backend-config.yaml
LimitNOFILE=16384:16384

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
EOT
```

Finally, reload systemd and enable the service:

```shell
$ systemctl --user daemon-reload
$ systemctl --user enable --now liwasc-backend
```

You can get the logs like so:

```shell
$ journalctl --user -u liwasc-backend
```

### Connecting the Frontend

Now that the backend is running, head over to [https://pojntfx.github.io/liwasc/](https://pojntfx.github.io/liwasc/). Alternatively, as described in [About the Frontend](#about-the-frontend), you can also choose to self-host. Once you're on the page, you should be presented with the following setup page:

![Setup page](./assets/setup.png)

You'll have to enter your own information here; the `Backend URL` is the URL on which the backend runs, the `OIDC Issuer`, `Client ID` and `Redirect URL` are the same values that you've set the backend up with above.

Finally, click on `Login`, and if everything worked out fine you should be presented with the initial launch screen:

ðŸš€ **That's it**! We hope you enjoy using liwasc.
